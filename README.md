# Brick Breaker - ImmediateOpenGL

## Introduction
This repo contains the source code for a version of Brick Breaker that was made in C++ with immediate mode OpenGL. It was an in-class assignment for an introductory computer graphics course in 2016.

Most of the gameplay logic can be found in src/main.cpp. We were given a simple immediate mode framework to work on and then had to build the full game ourselves.

## How To Run
Running the code requires compiling it with an IDE such as Visual Studio, or via command line.
